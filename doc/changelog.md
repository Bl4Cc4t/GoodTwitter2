#### Changes
- Ordered the settings page and made it easier to find what you're looking for
- *Hide Who To Follow* now is *Hide Follow Suggestions*.

  You can choose what to hide: users, topics and/or lists (in the sidebar and the timeline).

- ~~some more white follow buttons (lists and topics) changed back to the colored variant (#266, #272)~~
  This was reverted by Twitter itself after 2 months.
- Card embeds in tweets now also expand with *Expand t.co shortlinks* activated
- Like usual, many bugfixes

#### Removed
- *Show NSFW Media in Messages* sadly no longer works/isn't possible to do anymore, so I removed it.

- Clicking on the "home" button on`/home` returns to top again (scrolling issue, [#229](https://github.com/Bl4Cc4t/GoodTwitter2/issues/229))

## [0.0.27](https://github.com/Bl4Cc4t/GoodTwitter2/pull/221)

  - [Legacy profile] It is less likely for wrong data to appear, but it still can happen (I'm not sure how to fix this)
  - autoscroll on the search page now disabled again (when clicking the text input and then clicking on the page again, it scrolled all the way up again)
- Twitter changed the way tooltips work. Since they are transparent now, they are not that great to read. I made them solid for now
